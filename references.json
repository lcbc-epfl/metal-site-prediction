The vast amount of experimentally and computationally resolved protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) offers the possibility of training deep learning models to aid the predictions of their biological relevance. We present here DeepRank, a general, configurable deep learning framework for data mining PPIs using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DeepRank maps features of PPIs onto 3D grids and trains a user-specified CNN on these 3D grids. DeepRank allows for efficient training of 3D CNNs with data sets containing millions of PPIs and supports both classification and regression. We demonstrate the performance of DeepRank on two distinct challenges: The classification of biological versus crystallographic PPIs, and the ranking of docking models. For both problems DeepRank is competitive with, or outperforms, state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the framework for research in structural biology.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigate the capability of a deep neural network model to automate design of sequences onto protein backbones, having learned directly from crystal structure data and without any human-specified priors. The model generalizes to native topologies not seen during training, producing experimentally stable designs. We evaluate the generalizability of our method to a <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> TIM-barrel scaffold. The model produces novel sequences, and high-resolution crystal structures of two designs show excellent agreement with in silico models.

Through an enormous experimental effort<jats:sup>1–4</jats:sup>, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined<jats:sup>5</jats:sup>, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences<jats:sup>6,7</jats:sup>. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’<jats:sup>8</jats:sup>—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>. Despite recent progress<jats:sup>10–14</jats:sup>, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.</jats:p>",

The three-dimensional structures of threonine-199--&gt;aspartate (T199D) and threonine-199--&gt;glutamate (T199E) CAIIs, determined by x-ray crystallographic methods to resolutions of 2.35 Angstrum and 2.2 Angstrum, respectively, reveal a tetrahedral metal-binding site consisting of H94, H96, H119, and the engineered carboxylate side chain, which displaces zinc-bound hydroxide. Although the stereochemistry of neither engineered carboxylate-zinc interaction is comparable to that found in naturally occurring protein zinc-binding sites, protein-zinc affinity is enhanced in T199E CAII demonstrating that ligand-metal separation is a significant determinant of carboxylate-zinc affinity. In contrast, the three-dimensional structure of threonine-199--&gt;histidine (T199H) CAII, determined to 2.25-Angstrum resolution, indicates that the engineered imidazole side chain rotates away from the metal and does not coordinate to zinc; this results in a weaker zinc-binding site. All three of these substitutions nearly obliterate CO2 hydrase activity, consistent with the role of zinc-bound hydroxide as catalytic nucleophile. The engineering of an additional protein ligand represents a general approach for increasing protein-metal affinity if the side chain can adopt a reasonable conformation and achieve inner-sphere zinc coordination. Moreover, this structure-assisted design approach may be effective in the development of high-sensitivity metal ion biosensors.</jats:p>",

The AlphaFold protein structure database makes available hundreds of thousands of protein structures. However, all these structures lack cofactors essential for their structural integrity and molecular function (e.g. hemoglobin lacks a bound heme), key ions essential for structural integrity (e.g. zinc-finger motifs) or catalysis (e.g. Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> or Zn<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> in metalloproteases), and ligands that are important for biological function (e.g. kinase structures lack ADP or ATP). Here, we present AlphaFill, an algorithm based on sequence and structure similarity, to “transplant” such “missing” small molecules and ions from experimentally determined structures to predicted protein models. These publicly available structural annotations are mapped to predicted protein models, to help scientists interpret biological function and design experiments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Protein design is challenging because it requires searching through a vast combinatorial space that is only sparsely functional. Self-supervised learning approaches offer the potential to navigate through this space more effectively and thereby accelerate protein engineering. We introduce a sequence denoising autoencoder (DAE) that learns the manifold of protein sequences from a large amount of potentially unlabelled proteins. This DAE is combined with a function predictor that guides sampling towards sequences with higher levels of desired functions. We train the sequence DAE on more than 20M unlabeled protein sequences spanning many evolutionarily diverse protein families and train the function predictor on approximately 0.5M sequences with known function labels. At test time, we sample from the model by iteratively denoising a sequence while exploiting the gradients from the function predictor. We present a few preliminary case studies of protein design that demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach, which we refer to as “deep manifold sampling”, including metal binding site addition, function-preserving diversification, and global fold change.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Predicting mutation-induced changes in protein thermodynamic stability (ΔΔG) is of great interest in protein engineering, variant interpretation, and protein biophysics. We introduce ThermoNet, a deep, 3D-convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) designed for structure-based prediction of ΔΔGs upon point mutation. To leverage the image-processing power inherent in CNNs, we treat protein structures as if they were multi-channel 3D images. In particular, the inputs to ThermoNet are uniformly constructed as multi-channel voxel grids based on biophysical properties derived from raw atom coordinates. We train and evaluate ThermoNet with a curated data set that accounts for protein homology and is balanced with direct and reverse mutations; this provides a framework for addressing biases that have likely influenced many previous ΔΔG prediction methods. ThermoNet demonstrates performance comparable to the best available methods on the widely used S<jats:sup>sym</jats:sup> test set. In addition, ThermoNet accurately predicts the effects of both stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, while most other methods exhibit a strong bias towards predicting destabilization. We further show that homology between S<jats:sup>sym</jats:sup> and widely used training sets like S2648 and VariBench has likely led to overestimated performance in previous studies. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of ThermoNet in predicting the ΔΔGs for two clinically relevant proteins, p53 and myoglobin, and for pathogenic and benign missense variants from ClinVar. Overall, our results suggest that 3D-CNNs can model the complex, non-linear interactions perturbed by mutations, directly from biophysical properties of atoms.</jats:p>",

In contrast with existing methods, our work does not require computationally expensive higher-order representations in intermediate layers while it still achieves competitive or better performance. In addition, whereas existing methods are limited to equivariance on 3 dimensional spaces, our model is easily scaled to higher-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on dynamical systems modelling, representation learning in graph autoencoders and predicting molecular properties.",

    "abstract": "Predicting how a drug-like molecule binds to a specific protein target is a core problem in drug discovery. An extremely fast computational binding method would enable key applications such as fast virtual screening or drug engineering. Existing methods are computationally expensive as they rely on heavy candidate sampling coupled with scoring, ranking, and fine-tuning steps. We challenge this paradigm with EquiBind, an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning model performing direct-shot prediction of both i) the receptor binding location (blind docking) and ii) the ligand's bound pose and orientation. EquiBind achieves significant speed-ups and better quality compared to traditional and recent baselines. Further, we show extra improvements when coupling it with existing fine-tuning techniques at the cost of increased running time. Finally, we propose a novel and fast fine-tuning model that adjusts torsion angles of a ligand's rotatable bonds based on closed-form global minima of the von Mises angular distance to a given input atomic point cloud, avoiding previous expensive differential evolution strategies for energy minimization.",

    "abstract": "All published rotamer libraries contain some rotamers that exhibit impossible internal atomic overlaps if built in ideal geometry with all hydrogen atoms. Removal of uncertain residues (mainly those with B-factors >/=40 or van der Waals overlaps >/=0.4 A) greatly improves the clustering of rotamer populations. Asn, Gln, or His side chains additionally benefit from flipping of their planar terminal groups when required by atomic overlaps or H-bonding. Sensitivity to skew and to the boundaries of chi angle bins is avoided by using modes rather than traditional mean values. Rotamer definitions are listed both as the modal values and in a preferred version that maximizes common atoms between related rotamers. The resulting library shows significant differences from previous ones, differences validated by considering the likelihood of systematic misfitting of models to electron density maps and by plotting changes in rotamer frequency with B-factor. Few rotamers now show atomic overlaps in ideal geometry; those overlaps are relatively small and can be understood in terms of bond angle distortions compensated by favorable interactions. The new library covers 94.5% of examples in the highest quality protein data with 153 rotamers and can make a significant contribution to improving the accuracy of new structures.

    "abstract": "Farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors can suppress tumor cell proliferation without substantially interfering with normal cell growth, thus holding promise for cancer treatment. A structure-based approach to the design of improved FT inhibitors relies on knowledge of the conformational flexibility of the zinc-containing active site of FT. Although several X-ray structures of FT have been reported, detailed information regarding the active site conformational flexibility of the enzyme is still not available. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of FT can offer the requisite information, but have not been applied due to a lack of effective methods for simulating the four-ligand coordination of zinc in proteins. Here, we report in detail the problems that occurred in the conventional MD simulations of the zinc-bound FT and a solution to these problems by employing a simple method that uses cationic dummy atoms to impose orientational requirement for zinc ligands. A successful 1.0 ns (1.0 fs time step) MD simulation of zinc-bound FT suggests that nine conserved residues (Asn127alpha, Gln162alpha, Asn165alpha, Gln195alpha, His248beta, Lys294beta, Leu295beta, Lys353beta, and Ser357beta) in the active site of mammalian FT are relatively mobile. Some of these residues might be involved in the ligand-induced active site conformational rearrangement upon binding and deserve attention in screening and design of improved FT inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy.",
